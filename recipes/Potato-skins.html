    <h2>Loaded potato skins</h2>
    <p>Enjoy these potato skins as a relaxed starter or snack. Use chives instead of spring onion for a milder flavour, or omit the bacon for a veggie version</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium baking potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 rashers streaky bacon</li>
        <li>75g soured cream</li>
        <li>1 chopped spring onion or 2 tbsp finely chopped chives</li>
        <li>75g cheddar coarsely grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Put the baking potatoes on a baking tray. Prick all over with a fork and rub with a little oil. Cook potatoes in oven for 1 hr until golden and cooked all the way through. Remove from oven. Allow potatoes to cool for 15 mins.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking, heat 1 tsp oil in a medium frying pan and fry the bacon for 5-8 mins until crisp. Leave to cool, then transfer to a board and finely chop.</li>
        <li>Cut the slightly cooled potatoes in half and scoop the flesh from the skin into a large bowl, leaving a little around the edges. Put the skins back on the baking tray, scooped side up.</li>
        <li>Mash the potato flesh and soured cream together using a fork or masher. Stir in the cooled bacon, most of the spring onion or chives and half of the cheddar. Season to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide the potato mixture evenly between the cavities of the potato skins. Sprinkle the remaining cheddar over each filled potato half. Return the potatoes to the oven for 20 mins until golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle over the remaining spring onion or chives and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
